## Configuration

### `Environment Variables`

#### `SECRET_KEY_BASE`

This key is used to verify the integrity of signed cookies. If it is changed,
all old signed cookies will become invalid.

Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random, no regular words
or youâ€™ll be exposed to dictionary attacks. You can use `rake secret` to
generate a secure secret key.

The framework we use for managing user authentication (Devise) also requires this
to be set in production in order to generate user tokens.

#### `SERVICE_URL`

This is used to build links in emails(invitation, password reset etc). It must
be set in the production environment to `https://mps-prod.dsd.io/`.

#### `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_HOSTNAME`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_DOMAIN`

These configure email delivery in the production environment.
